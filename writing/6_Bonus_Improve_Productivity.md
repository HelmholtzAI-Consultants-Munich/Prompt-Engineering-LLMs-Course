## Bonus: Use an LLM to Enhance your Daily Productivity

We all have tasks we struggle to start, even when we know we need to get them done. Whether it's decluttering your workspace, exercising regularly, organizing your schedule, etc. Use an LLM to brainstorm creative strategies and practical steps to tackle one of these task.

### Hints
- Don’t limit yourself, ask the LLM to suggest techniques you’ve never considered. Sometimes, an outside perspective (even from an AI) can really surprise you!
