## Exercise: Write an Abstract

Imagine you have completed a research project and are ready to publish your findings. Use an LLM to draft an abstract for your paper. Focus on summarizing key aspects of your research such as objectives, methods, results, and conclusions. Think about your research or a topic you know well. 

- Evaluate the quality of your abstract: Does it clearly summarize the key aspects of your research? Is it concise and relevant to your target publication?"

### Hints:
- Think about a target conference/ journal
- Specify output constraints to the LLM, e.g., 150-250 words or 3-5 sentences.
- The cognitive verifier pattern can be helpful here to generate an abstract of better quality
