## Exercise: Code Review and Refactoring

Here, we have a [python](src/ml_model.py) and an [R](src/ml_model.r) script for classifying the Iris dataset (choose the one you are most comfortable with). With the help of an LLM, make the code better.

### Hints
- Ask how is the code quality? Are there any redundancies in the code? Is it efficient?
- What can be refactored
- What would be a better software architecture for reproducibility?
