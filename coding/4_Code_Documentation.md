## Exercise: Code Documentation

Take the previous example, you can use these refactored versions ([python](src/refactored.py)) ([r](src/refactored.r)), or your own. With an LLMs help, document the code.

### Hints
- Generate docstrings (experiment with formats)
- Create a readme for the code
- Think of something else!
